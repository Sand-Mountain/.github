# What is this place?

This is a place to practice coding.

It doesn't matter if:
* the repo functions (proofs of concept are welcome)
* the feature(s) is an original idea
* the author is not an expert in the technologies or the domain

Create and collaborate with whatever repo you want.

# Why?

>The only thing certain in life is uncertainty.

## Keep your brain working.

Like in many professions, the competencies that employers demand could change quickly. As software engineers, we have to keep educating ourselves.

We can't procrastinate learning. In physical health, the longer you wait to exercise, the more difficult it is to start. The same is true with your brain.

There are many examples of middle-aged employees who feel too demotivated to learn new things because they have grown comfortable with their jobs. They think their industry will never become obsolete. Or they think they can procrastinate the learning until they lose their jobs.

Do not become like those people. Take action now!

## Learn efficiently by collaborating.

If you want your app to be more sophisticated, then you need to spend more time on coding. But not everyone has a lot of free time.

Collaboration could help. This is especially true for full-stack apps. 

For example - You want to practice a server-side technology. But you also want a UI. To solve this, you could find someone who wants to learn more about UI development, and you can focus on server-side development.

# Fundamental concepts and principles

Your brain needs **regular exercise** like your body does.

**Consistent small habits** ("baby steps") is better than seldomly taking big steps in self improvement.

**Learn by doing.** Want to learn a language? Focus more on coding in that language. Cap your time on reading tutorials. Long sessions of reading tutorials should be reserved for:
* Learning the stupidly basic fundamentals. EG: how to create variables.
* Solving your bugs.
